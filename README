Collection of Groovy classes used in rapid prototyping and/or one-off applications.

Unlike durbinlib, these classes are not compiled, and they generally are considered of lower overall quality and/or of too narrow use to be part of durbinlib. 


==================

IDEAS:

OnlinTable is nice, but often I am wanting to build a map between two different columns. 
Maybe make a class to do just that.  Something like: 

name2idMap = new MapExtractor(fileName,nameColumn,idColumn)

You could even generate a 2D map by giving a third column

idByCompound2Concentration = new MapExtractor(fileName,idColumn,compoundColumn,concentrationColumn)
